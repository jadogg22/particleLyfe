# Particle Lyfe

The biggest point to this repo is to stress test various aspects of the particle lyfe algorithm. First we're going to have a benchmark Vanilla JS version. This one Is going to have hardly any optimazations. Then I wanted to write a version where we use a "faster" language and maybe add some multithreading. The next step wer're going full blown GPU acceleration and rust. So its going to be a fun project and honestly its compairing apples and oranges but I'm the programer and I decide whats fun. 

## it's not about the destination, it's about the journey

Its my goal to document my findings and the process of writeing the code as more of like a blog style vs more of a documentation kinda thing. Mostly because at least the "Particle life algorithm" is pretty well documented. Many people out there have written wayyy better versions and documented it quite a bit better. So I'm just gonna leave it there.
